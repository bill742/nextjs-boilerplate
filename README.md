# NextJS Project Boilerplate

A boilerplate I use for creating my personal projects using NextJS, TypeScript, and Tailwind. Includes built-in linting and formatting with ESLint and Prettier.

## Features:

- ESLint rules
- Prettier configuration setup for Tailwind
- Icons from [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- ShadCN/UI for theming and component library
- Node version file
- Custom 404 page
- Robots and Sitemap files
- VS Code settings and recommended extensions
