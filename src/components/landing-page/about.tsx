            This is a boilerplate I put together for creating my front-end
            projects with <strong>NextJS</strong>, TypeScript, and Tailwind. It
            includes all of the linting and formatting rules that I like to use
            with ESLint and Prettier as well as a theme switcher for dark and
            light modes. It also includes a few other niceties like a custom 404
            page, robots.txt and sitemap.xml files, and VS Code settings.
          </p>
